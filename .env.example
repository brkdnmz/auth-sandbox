## Sender email configuration
# You may create a new Gmail account for testing out the app yourself.
# See https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600 (Option 2: Send email with the Gmail SMTP server)
# For simplicity, you may use your own personal account. However, I wouldn't recommend that, since it's your "personal" account after all :D
# Sacrifice a few minutes to use a dummy account instead.
